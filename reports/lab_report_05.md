# Project Development Weekly Progress Report #5

**Team Name:** Collaborative Science Platform

**Date:** 07.11.2023

## Progress Summary
**Past two weeks**, we successfully deployed a fully functional application as part of Milestone 1. Our front-end and back-end are seamlessly integrated, and design for all existing pages has been completed. In this version, users can perform key actions such as signing up, signing in, logging out, searching profiles or nodes on the home page, and viewing the details of nodes and profiles, whether their own or others'. We received valuable feedback during our presentation and have incorporated these suggestions into our project plan.

**Subteams:**
- **Front-end Team**: Zülal, Bengisu, Abdullah, Mehmet, Ömer Faruk, Leyla
- **Back-end Team**: Ömer Şükrü, Ahmed Bera, Oğuz, Hakan, Arda, Ali Mert

**Our objective for the following week**, our primary focus will be on enhancing the performance of our application. During the presentation, it came to our attention that the node view page experienced longer load times than desired. Also, we will be implementing routing in the front-end of our application. In addition to these feedback-driven enhancements, we will begin working on the implementation of requirements related to graph visualization, which is a crucial aspect of our project.

None

## Planned vs. Actual

## Risks
We are currently utilizing free-tier products from cloud service providers. While we are making every effort to design our API and pages to achieve the best possible performance, it's essential to recognize that our performance is inherently tied to the limitations of these free-tier services.
