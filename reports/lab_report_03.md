## Planned vs. Actual
- We planned to update UML diagrams according to changes in the requirements. However we decided wait for the requirement revision of the product owner before updating the diagrams.
- This week we planned to create all user models however we decided to implement only the basic user model since we won't need other models for now. So we decided to postpone implementing other models.

## Risks
- Some of the tasks are dependent therefore we may have timing issues.
- While it's not a significant risk, it's important to acknowledge that implementing the homepage before incorporating search functionalities and graph visualization is a deliberate decision. This approach prioritizes a generic structure for the homepage at this stage, with plans to enhance it over time.

# Implementation Strategies
1. Main Branch Protection Strategy: Developers can not commit directly to main branch, backend branch and frontend branch.
2. Unit tests will be implemented by the developers who developed related features. They have to be included in the same pull request with the related feature.
3. In the frontend side of the project, vscode flutter plugin's default formatter will be used by all developers. And in the backend side of the project, vscode django plugin's default will be used by all developers.
4. Branch's will be created based on the features that will be implamented.
5. Pull requests will be connected to the related issues.
