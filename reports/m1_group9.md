# 4. Project Plan

You can view our project plan [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/wiki/Project-Plan).

# 5. Communication Plan

We choose Discord as our main communication tool. We had a Discord server from last semester. This semester, we decided to continue using it. We added new members of our team to our server. The Discord server has several text channels for different purposes. Each team member uses the relevant channel to discuss various parts of the project. In addition, there are voice channels as well. Those who want to work together online use these channels to communicate with each other. The functionalities that Discord provides us are well-suited for our project. In the Discord, we also share some project related files such as apk. files and information like some keys as well. In addition to Discord, we use Whatsapp for communication, too. It is a great tool to reach a team member quickly. We announce some reminders and updates on Whatsapp as well.
We had our meetings at lab hours every Tuesday. At the lab hours, we discussed the important matters with the project owner, and created a project plan accordingly. In each meeting, we took notes and distributed the necessary jobs among the team members. The weekly reports of our meetings can be found in our Wiki page. In addition to the weekly meetings, those who work on the same part of the project had their own meetings as well on Discord.
For assigning jobs and tracking the progress, we used GitHub.
Lastly, we use a common Notion workspace where we can keep drafts of our work.

# 8. Milestone Review

## The Summary of the Project Status and Our Future Plans

Our application has a functioning log in and sign up pages now. One can create an account on our platform and log in to it by using the mobile app or the web application. In the sign up page, there is a responsive strong password checker which prevents prospective users from choosing weak passwords. Furthermore, we have a functioning home page where users and theorems are listed. In the home page, there is a search bar where a user can search a theorem, a user, or theorems of a user. A user can view the profile page of another user by clicking on the card of a user. Also, every theorem has its own page where theorem related stuff such as proofs, references, citations, and questions can be viewed.
In the following weeks, we plan to increase the search functionality further. Also, we realized that our system responds at a noticeably long time. Therefore, we will work on optimizing the database operations. Since there are many mathematical notations in theorems and proofs, we need to add a good Latex renderer to our project so that texts can be viewed without a problem. The home page comes with an empty white page. This is not something which is expected from an application. Once we implement an infinite scroll pagination, latest works which a user might find interesting will be listed on the home page. As he/she scrolls down, new content will be pulled and displayed on the page. Also, it would be beneficial to add some form of advertisement about our app/site, explaining its purpose and benefits. This would not only enhance the user experience but also help us reach the right audience and convey the value of our platform from the very beginning. In addition, there will be a workspace page where a user can work on his/her theorem with other contributors collaboratively. Lastly, there will be a graph page where related theorems, conjectures etc. will be displayed.

## The Summary of the Customer Feedback and Reflections

Based on our observations of the audience during the presentation, we noticed that people were engaged and often smiling, particularly during the initial minutes of the presentation. In general, our UI design and overall appearance left a positive impression. Particularly, our sign-up process was well-received by the audience due to its user-friendly and clean design. Some people asked about certain functionalities that were not included in the demo but planned for the final milestone. We made our best efforts to explain our future plans and address their questions. Generally we managed to convince them.
Despite these positive reactions, we noticed that the data retrieval time from the backend server was longer than ideal, which led to some dissatisfaction among the audience. Additionally the search options provided (author, theorem, by) seemed to be confusing for some of the audience members and our home page is found pretty empty. We might need to provide more explanatory guidance on our platform. Furthermore, our PO identified a bug from our side where the home page bar doesn't always change according to the page.
At the end, we received valuable feedback from our potential users, particularly researchers, regarding their preferences for paper search on our app. We have noted their advice and suggestions for improving the search and filtering features.

## Evaluation of the Status of Deliverables and Its Impact on Our Project Plan

### 1. Software Requirements Specification

We revised the project requirements that we prepared during the last semester. We have found some ambiguities and updated the requirements to make everything clear. We evaluated feedback from our product owner and improved the requirements accordingly. The revisions will affect the design, implementation and testing phases of the development process.

### 2. Software Design

Software design documents were created last semester based on the initial project requirements, but with the revised requirements, we needed to update the software design documents. We revised existing UML diagrams and made necessary adjustments to ensure that they are accurately reflecting the updated requirements.

### 3. Scenarios and Mockups

We decided to go on with the existing scenarios and mockups, as they still align with the project requirements.

### 4. Project Plan and Responsibility Assignment Matrix

First we were confused about when and how to prepare a responsibility assignment matrix. After discussing with the product owner, we distributed the tasks among the team members and created a plan for the project.

### 5. Communication Plan

Our communication plan was well-suited for our project and facilitated the development process. Features of Discord such as providing multiple text and audio channels helped us to maintain discussions on different topics simultaneously. We will continue with the same plan for effective communication between team members.

### 6. Weekly Reports

Weekly reports that we prepared during the lab sessions were crucial in tracking the progress of our development process. We had an opportunity to keep track of the issues that the team is working on and will work on next week. Also, we identified the risks beforehand and discussed how to avoid them. These reports also helped us to know how fast we should be progressing to reach the final milestone of our project on time.

### 7. Pre-release of the Software Project

You can find the pre-release of our application [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/releases/tag/customer-milestone-1). It includes all the material in our project repository along with the APK of our mobile application. Pre-release of the application includes sign-in, sign-up pages that provide authenticated access to the platform. Home page is also included in the application that allows users to search users and theorems (nodes). Users can see the details of a node on the node view page by clicking the nodes found in the home page. Also, users are able to see their own profile page and other users’ profile page. Up to now, we have provided almost all of the features that we aimed to until the first customer milestone. However, we need to improve the response time of the pages, especially the node details page. Editing profile info should be functional and search function should be more user friendly. Also, the router of the project should be revised and improved to display the right link. After these improvements, we can proceed according to the project plan.

## Evaluation of Tools and Processes We Have Used to Manage Our Team Project

While developing the project, we used different platforms and tools to be able to work collaboratively. Each tool that we used during the implementation of the project allowed us to work efficiently. They helped us to work on the same documents and files simultaneously and keep track of the progression of the tasks assigned to the team members. Also, we have used some platforms to communicate with each other and get help. We selected our tools based on their simplicity, ease of use and efficiency.

### 1. GitHub

Github is the main tool that we used to track the progress of our project. All the project related files eventually end up in our GitHub repository. Each documentation, schema, diagram, research, and assignment has been listed in the GitHub page of our project. The wiki page of our project contains necessary documentation of the project for those who are interested.
We also used GitHub to assign tasks to team members and to track the project and work together in a more organized way. GitHub has extremely good tools for that too. It is easy to track the issues according to their starting and ending time, and it is easy to prioritize them with GitHub Projects. On the other hand, GitHub Actions is really good for automated unit tests. We can see the results of automatically executed unit tests when we open a pull request before merging it.
Sometimes, we asked questions about the parts that we didn’t understand via comment sections of our issues. In order to confirm the correctness of our work, we asked reviews of our teammates for our work.
Github is a great tool in terms of collective work, management and distribution of tasks. It eased and simplified our job considerably. It has played a critical role throughout the development of the project up until now.

### 2. Discord

Discord has been the main communication platform that we have used so far. We continued to use the Discord server that we used in the last semester. We added our new teammates to the server in the first week of this semester. In our Discord server, a group member is able to ask questions about the project in the relevant channels of the server. All links, related files, and settings for our project are shared to the team members via Discord. Additionally, those who want to work together conduct our online meetings on our Discord server since the voice channels of Discord are a perfect tool for this purpose. The presence of multiple voice channels helps different subteams work on different tasks simultaneously. Some materials and documents are sent to our Discord server so that everyone can see and make necessary changes. In this manner, Discord served as an intermediate platform as well. One of the most important aspects of Discord for our project is that it included only project related materials since we avoid using it for our personal tasks.

### 3. Whatsapp

Whatsapp is mainly used to reach a team member quickly. For instance, it is used to remind the deadline of a required work. Based on this example, we think that Whatsapp is a great messaging platform to reach a team member about urgent things. In addition, we opened polls to make democratic decisions about our project. We also informed some team members via Whatsapp about tasks assigned to them in case they don’t see the related issues in GitHub. We use Whatsapp to ask our team members when they will complete their tasks because some tasks need previous ones to be completed. In addition, we usually ask help from other team members if there is a confusing part in a task that was assigned to us. Considering all of these, Whatsapp was our secondary platform that we used to communicate with each other and organize our work.

### 4. Postman

We use Postman to document the requests which are implemented by the backend team. For a frontend developer to understand how to use these requests, he/she needs well-designed documentation and some examples. Therefore, we should use a platform which serves as a bridge between the frontend team and the backend team. Postman is a great tool for this purpose.

### 5. Flutter

In the second week of the semester, the frontend team decided to use Flutter. It is a great framework which comes with a huge widget library. Many plugins which are available for Flutter are maintained by Google and work without a problem. There is a package manager called pub which allows easy installation for custom packages. The programming language on which Flutter built is Dart, and it has some cool features such as null-safety which reduces the risk of run-time errors. What is more is that an app built in Flutter can be compiled to many platforms, which is the main reason we choose Flutter over other alternatives.

## Member: Arda Arslan

**Responsibilities:**
I am at the back-end team. So, my responsibilities evolved around back-end development tasks. I've created new python classes,defined fields and functions, which were to be used as database models. I've written and documented API endpoints that gather requested information, ready to be processed within the front-end application. All classes or code segments written are tested with test cases/scenarios after implementation.

**Main contributions:**
First, I examined requirements, suggested modifications, and applied them to the wiki page after reaching a consensus with the group. Then I investigated proposed back-end technologies and expressed my views to the team. Shared my ideas on how to divide tasks and how to distribute them over semester, while preparing the project plan. After all, I’ve started working on back-end development.

I was assigned with my team on reviewing the project requirements and UML diagrams and preparing the project plan. I was also assigned for determining the authentication mechanisms, testing, and development environments together with my teammates.I had a role in the backend team and my technical assignments were made accordingly. I was responsible for backend tech selections, implementation of some classes and models, and some of the APIs with my friends from the backend team. I was also individually assigned for implementation of some of the APIs, classes, models, and their migrations to the database.

**Main contributions:**
I reviewed the requirements and UML diagrams on my own and discussed the results in a meeting with some teammates who reviewed them too. I determined the authentication mechanisms for our project with my backend teammates.I implemented some classes with their properties and methods. I also made related migrations to the database accordingly. On the other hand, I implemented some of the APIs and documented them in our postman workspace for our frontend team to utilize them. On the other hand, I took part in the tech selection for the backend and I determined the file structure outlines of our backend side. Additionally, I made the initial setup of the backend project too.

## Member: Ömer Faruk Ünal

**Responsibilities:**
I am a member of the frontend team. I joined this team this year, so I needed to inspect all diagrams, requirements, and designs. I was responsible for both creating and maintaining the Frontend of our application. I initialized the structure and design of the application, created some screens, and reviewed other codes.

**Main Contributions:**
Because I am more experienced and familiar with the technology I reviewed almost everyone's code, and handled conflicts. I helped other people dealing with some hard, major conflicts that may affect the app. Other than that I created the flow in the application and main code structure and MVVM design of the application. I also coded generic abstract page design that will make everyone's job easier. I coded the search bar, search function, and authentication flow.

**Code-Related Significant Issues:**

- Designing file structure outlines for front-end [#254](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/254)
- Designed the signup page [#266](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/266)

- Implemented search functionality and improved search bar design [#289](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/289), [#328](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/328)
- Created a generic abstract parent page that will be used in all other pages [#290](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/290), [#315](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/315)
- Improved login and signup screen and authentication flow [#314](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/314), [#347](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/347)
- Implemented node and user providers to connect backend to the UI [#289](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/289), [#331](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/331)
- Added search functionality to providers

**Management-Related Significant Issues:**

- Onboarded the project, revised designs and diagrams. [#237](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/237)
- Determining Frontend requirements and tasks [#238](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/238)

- Decision for Frontend Technologies [#249](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/249)

**Pull Requests:**

- **Frontend Initialization [#269](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/269):** Created the app and initialized the file structures following domain-driven design principles and MVVM app design.
- **Signup Page [#282](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/282):** Design of this page has been done by other members. I reviewed the code, suggested some changes. I connected the backend and app via providers and made the page functional.
- **Profile page [#320](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/320):** This is a pull request which contains many commits from many members of the frontend team. I did lint checks, fixed some errors. I added responsive try catch blocks, and provided some feedback to users. I handled what happens if the user is not logged in.
- **Page with bar [#309](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/309):** Implemented a generic screen that will be used in all other screens. This made many things easier to handle for us.
- **Revise authentications screen [#314](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/314):** I fixed errors in the Authentication screens. I improved the flow and added some additional error checks.
- **Update generic page [#346](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/346):** Updated generic page. Added some paddings, colors, and made it more user-friendly.
- **Home page update [#353](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/353):** Home page items were dummy. I made the home page items navigational by integrating data from the backend. These changes impacted other parts of the application and resulted in a few conflicts. To streamline the process, I patiently waited for other contributors to complete and merge their branches. Subsequently, I merged the frontend into my branch, resolved the conflicts, and then merged my branch back into the frontend.

**Additional Information:**

- At some point, we were dependent on the same objects and needed to change them simultaneously without informing others. This caused significant conflicts between branches. Unfortunately, I had to spend a significant amount of time resolving these conflicts. I also conducted reviews on nearly every part of the frontend.

## Member: Zülal Molla

**Responsibilities:**
I was responsible for the revision of the requirements and class diagrams. I was also in charge of creating a responsive, reliable and user friendly user interface.

**Main contributions:**
I contributed to the design and functionality of the signup page. I wrote providers to get profile page info and node details.I took part in designing the profile page. I created a basic structure for the profile page and implemented the about me section which includes personal info such as name, surname and email. I designed and implemented the node view page. I wrote a custom tab to be used in scrollable pages which is also used in the profile page.

**Code-related significant issues:**

- Enhancement for profile page [#332](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/issues/332)
- Node view Page [#321](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/issues/321)

- merge Frontend to main [#365](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/365): This PR was a cumulative merge of the frontend branch to the main with all commits of the frontend team.
- Node view page [#351](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/351), [#359](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/359): These PRs include the details of the implementation of the node view page that displays details of a node. Since I was the only person developing this page there was not any conflict.
- Profile page [#320](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/320): I created a basic layout for the profile page. Implemented a provider to fetch profile info of the user and about me section. There were conflicts with the fields of the user class. Since the id of the user is not recorded on every page, I revised it as optional.
- Signup page[ #282](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/282): I contributed to the design and the implementation of the signup page. It was one of the first pages that we created. Therefore, there was no conflict with other branches.
- Enhance home[ #342](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/342): I reviewed and tested the code in my local workspace. Although there was not any conflict with the main branch, there was a possible conflict with a branch that I was currently working on. Therefore, I suggested updating the related node model. In addition, contributors of the PR missed that we decided to not support custom profile pages for users. I reminded and we decided to fix it later.

**Additional information:**
I designed and created a logo for the application. Created custom text styles to make the fonts consistent all over the project.

## Member: Bengisu Kübra Takkin

**Responsibilities:**
I am a member of the Frontend team. I joined this semester so in the first week, my task was to study project requirements and the diagrams. My responsibility as a frontend team member was to create the pages that are assigned to me, review other pages, fix overflow errors and enhance the design if needed.

**Main contributions:**
I was also assigned to review the project requirements because I could see errors better as a new member who tries to learn about the project via reading requirements. After that I was assigned to review and fix sequence diagrams according to updates in requirements. I implemented a profile settings page both for web and mobile. I also contributed to implementing the sign up page and profile page.

**Code-related significant issues:**

- Implementing Signup Page [#288](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/issues/288)
- Implementing Profile Page [#320](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/issues/2320)
- Implementing Profile Settings Page and Enhancing the Desing [#334](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/issues/334)

**Management-related significant issues:**

**Pull requests:**

- [Signup page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/282)
- [Profile page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/320)
- [Account setting](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/360)
- [Changes for Profile Page and Account Settings Page](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group9/pull/364)

I Reviewed Profile Page and Account Setting pull requests. Merged them together with Leyla Yayladere since we were both working on those two branches. We reviewed and merged the branches with an online meeting.

There were many conflicts because the Account Setting branch was an old version of the Profile page branch. Since there were many updates on the origin branch, there were many conflicts between updated and old areas. Also some of the problems originated from formatting. Lastly, I learned that I should not change the name of the classes since git thinks it's a new file. We had to fix that part too while merging those branches.

## Member: Ali Mert Geben

**Responsibilities:**

I was a part of the back-end team, so my responsibilities mainly revolved around back-end tasks. I was responsible for implementing some models for the database according to previously created classes accordingly and implementing their functions and fields. One of my responsibilities was implementing API functions to be used for the front-end and I also reviewed my teammates’ work from time to time.

**Main contributions:**

I researched technologies regarding database and back-end and talked with my teammates to choıse which one to use. After sharing my ideas regarding this technologies I started working on the back-end development of the project.
