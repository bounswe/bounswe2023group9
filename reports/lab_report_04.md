# Project Development Weekly Progress Report #4

**Team Name:** Collaborative Science Platform

**Date:** 24.10.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week** we focused on defining critical data models and classes for user types, nodes, proofs, theorems ensuring a strong foundation for project's core functionality. Additionally, we did also work on creating a generic page template, set up home and profile pages.

**Subteams:**
- **Front-end Team**: Zülal, Bengisu, Abdullah, Mehmet, Ömer Faruk, Leyla
- **Back-end Team**: Ömer Şükrü, Ahmed Bera, Oğuz, Hakan, Arda, Ali Mert

**Our objective for the following week** is to focus on creating a functioning application for the presentation. For now, backend and frontend are not connected enough and the design of the pages needs to be enhanced further. We aim to eliminate these problems as much as possible.

## Completed tasks that were not planned for the week
None

## Planned vs. Actual
- We planned to implement the profile page completely. But, due to the dependency on the API calls that are not implemented yet, we had to postpone the development of the some of the features and screen tests of the profile page to the next week.
- Profile Page GET API could not be implemented within this week, will be implemented the following week.
- Home Page GET API is mostly implemented but will be completed the following week.

## Risks
- Frontend pages have dependency on implementation of APIs. Therefore, if they are not delivered on time, frontend tasks might be incomplete.
